# Class-Clicker
A web application that implements a simple desktop and mobile “clicker” for class.

- The app allows users to submit answers to questions posed in class, and provides a separate URL end point for getting the results of the submitted responses. 
- When the user makes a choice and hits “submit”, their answer should be stored in your MVC model. 
- On submit, the page provides feedback to the user regarding the choice that they made (e.g. “D”)
